# Personal Website
Hello and welcome to my personal website (work in progress).

This repository originally started from a step-by-step Git tutorial offered on https://www.w3schools.com.

I intend to gradually work away on it and expand it into a personal portfolio/showcase of not only computer science and coding related accolades, accomplishments, and interests, but also general life pursuits and stories. The long-term plan is to have several functioning versions of this website running, each with its own tech stack to showcase my skills with those domains.

NOTE: If the page looks very rudimentary, don't worry, I know. I'm taking my time and having fun with the process! :)

## Roadmap

### Version 1
Landing page with personal details. Literally just a simple website with built via HTML and CSS.

#### Version 1.1
Expanded landing page with JS functionality. Outline of a project page.

### Final
Hubspotesque logo with branching skill trees.
How about a scheduler app for time management?
Import photos too!
