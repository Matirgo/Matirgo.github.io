# Personal Website
Hello and welcome to my personal website (work in progress).

This repository originally started from a step-by-step Git tutorial offered on https://www.w3schools.com.

I intend to gradually work away on it and expand it into a personal portfolio/showcase of not only computer science and coding related accolades, accomplishments, and interests, but also general life pursuits and stories.

NOTE: If the page looks very rudimentary, don't worry, I know. I'm taking my time and having fun with the process! :)
